        step Optional sort your lentils to make sure there arent any small stones left. Rinse the lentils and let them soak for a couple of hours in lukewarm water before cooking.Put all the ingredients together in a saucepan and cook for 45mn to 1 hour over medium heat, until the lentils are cooked.If you use a pressure cooker, the soup will be ready in 20 minutes.I serve mine with a handful of plum black olives, such as Volos.Find more recipes on my blog httpalalemon.com,
